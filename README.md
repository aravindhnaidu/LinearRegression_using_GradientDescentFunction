Linear regression using gradient descent function.
Linear regression with gradient descent involves finding the best-fitting line through data points by iteratively adjusting the line's parameters. 
The gradient descent algorithm updates the parameters in the direction that minimally reduces the error
(difference between predicted and actual values) until convergence, optimizing the line's fit.
